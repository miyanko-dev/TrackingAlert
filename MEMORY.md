# TrackingAlert — Memory

Updated 2026-09-30 after the Forever-only cleanup (2.1.0).

TrackingAlert is WoW Forever 1.60.x only, and always was. The vanilla feature lives in the separate GatherMate2Alert addon. The audit and the cleanup verified against Gethe `forever` @ `966519cf` (1.60.1.70124) and Ketho `forever` @ `4149af64` (1.60.1.70009). The installed client is 1.60.1.70009. Nothing has run in a client. On 2026-09-30, after the cleanup, `lua Tools/harness.lua` passed 79 of 79 (on Lua 5.5, not WoW's 5.1), which proves logic and wiring, not client behaviour.

## Current state

When a tracked node shows up, it pings and flashes the minimap. Two sources feed one alert:

- The minimap blip source runs the engine hit test on points on the minimap.
- The optional GatherMate2 source post-hooks `Display:addMiniPin`.

It also carries GatherMate2 circle tweaks: size, merge, and hiding icons.

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Version | 2.1.0. `## Interface: 16001` only, `## Author: miyanko`, `## Category: Map`, `## OptionalDeps: GatherMate2`, Addon Compartment fields. No `X-Category` |
| Git | `main` holds 2.1.0 (committed 2026-09-30, not pushed). `origin/main` = `719eacf` (2.0.0). History: `f832441` (1.0.0, already `16001`) → `4702355` → `719eacf` (2.0.0) → 2.1.0. No tags, no releases, no forks. The repo never held a 1.15 version, so it has no `1.15.x-backup` and needs none. This is a deliberate exception to the branch convention |
| Vanilla | Users keep GatherMate2Alert (`github.com/miyanko-dev/GatherMate2Alert`, `## Interface: 11509`, `main` = `1.15.x-backup` = `a946251`, re-checked 2026-09-30). It isn't cloned on this Mac |

The blip source:

- The scanner frame registers unconditionally. `Minimap:UpdateMouseoverAtPoint`, `C_TooltipInfo.GetMinimapMouseover`, `C_Minimap.GetViewRadius` and `VIGNETTE_MINIMAP_UPDATED` all exist in 1.60.1, so the old `ns.canProbe` check is gone (TA-3).
- `UpdateMouseoverAtPoint` is `SecretArguments = "AllowedWhenUntainted"` and only receives plain numbers.
- Secret values go through `ns.IsSecret` (`Core/Config.lua`): `pcall(issecretvalue, value)`, where a raise counts as secret and nil is never secret. A secret speed counts as standing still, a secret blip name reads as no blip, and a secret `guid` falls back to the position key (TA-2).

The GatherMate2 source:

- It attaches only if GatherMate2 loads, and every internal it reads is guarded.
- The hook fields exist on both upstream branches (`Display.lua` master:482-507, classic:471-491). The port source is `GatherMate2Alert.lua:76-208`.
- The native circle size is read off the first circle: 10 px on GatherMate2 `classic`, 12 px on `master`.

Zoning has one handler, in `Core/Alert.lua`: it sets the 5-second quiet window, then runs the `ns.OnZoning` callbacks. The scanner forgets its nodes and rebuilds its geometry; the GatherMate2 source forgets its circles (TA-8).

Options use Blizzard's native Settings vertical layout, with no canvas. This already matches the shared UI spec (item 7); the addon has no tool window, dialog or minimap button:

- Every control is a `Settings.RegisterProxySetting` over `ns.db`, so all 18 `TrackingAlertDB` keys keep their meaning. 17 have a control; `space` (the calibration) has none, so Defaults can't clear it. (Earlier notes said 19 keys; `Core/Config.lua` has 18.)
- Sections are Alert, Minimap nodes and GatherMate2. Child rows nest with `SetParentInitializer`.
- The node-type mute list is a multi-select `Settings.CreateDropdown`, like Blizzard's Nameplates page.
- Calibration status leads the Calibration tooltip. The button reads Calibrate or Recalibrate.
- `/tra` opens it with `Settings.OpenToCategory(category:GetID())`. The Addon Compartment entry stays (left-click opens, right-click toggles alerts).
- No hardcoded fonts, custom panel textures or hand-built widgets. The only custom texture is the minimap flash ring, the alert's own visual.

## Forever-only rework (done 2026-09-30, 2.1.0)

There was no Classic code to split out. This pass applied the audit fixes:

| ID | Severity | Finding | Done |
|---|---|---|---|
| TA-1 | High | With "Gathering nodes only" on (the default), `IsWanted` accepted only `Object` (4) or untyped data, but Forever's minimap tooltip most likely reports `Enum.TooltipDataType.MinimapMouseover` (21, `LuaEnum.lua:7733`; `SetMinimapMouseover` → `GetMinimapMouseover`, `TooltipDataHandler.lua:594`) | `IsWanted` also accepts 21. The harness fakes 21 and checks that a Unit-typed blip is skipped. The option stays; see issue 2 |
| TA-2 | Medium | `GetUnitSpeed` is `SecretWhenUnitStatsRestricted` (`UnitDocumentation.lua:335-338`), and the blip name was used unguarded as a table key | `ns.IsSecret` guard on speed, blip name and `guid` |
| TA-3 | Medium | `ns.canProbe` checked APIs every Forever build has | Removed, with the "no hit test" branch and its harness section |
| TA-4 | Medium | The GatherMate2 source is dormant: no GatherMate2 build declares 16001 | **Open, owner decision.** Unchanged |
| TA-5 | Medium | `MigrateLegacy` upgraded 1.0.0 saves that cannot exist | Removed, with its harness section |
| TA-6 | Low | A vignette leaving the minimap cleared its key, so it re-alerted on every re-entry | Both edges stamp the key, so the 3-minute window counts from when it was last on the minimap, and `Prune` ages it out |
| TA-7 | Low | Rotation ignored `C_Minimap.IsRotateMinimapIgnored()` | `GetCVarBool("rotateMinimap") and not C_Minimap.IsRotateMinimapIgnored()` (`MinimapDocumentation.lua:166`, non-nilable bool) |
| TA-8 | Low | Three frames handled the same zoning events | One handler in `Alert.lua` with `ns.OnZoning` callbacks |
| TA-9 | Low | Only `## X-Category` | `## Category: Map` (`AddonList.lua:456` reads `Category`). The Notes still name GatherMate2, since TA-4 is open |
| TA-10 | Low | `Media/pulse_ring.tga` was 4 MB, uncompressed, mode 100755 | Re-encoded losslessly as RLE (type 10, 1024×1024, 32 bpp, descriptor `0x28` top-left with 8 alpha bits, no packet crosses a scanline): 4,194,322 → 339,652 bytes. The decoded pixels are byte-identical, checked by a round trip and independently via macOS `sips`. Git mode is now 100644 |
| TA-11 | Low | README claimed the sound plays with effects muted, and gave the `_classic_beta_` path | Hedged as "meant to, not yet confirmed". Install says "the `Interface/AddOns/` folder of your WoW Forever install". The Classic Era pointer to GatherMate2Alert is gone |

The harness now also covers: one zoning frame, the tooltip-type filter, secret speed and names (including a raising `issecretvalue`), vignette re-entry, an ignored rotation, and GatherMate2 circles forgotten on zoning. Each new check was mutation-tested: reverting its fix makes it fail.

Nothing to do:

- Clean for 1.60.x: a single `16001` toc, no client splits, no `WOW_PROJECT_*`, no Era templates, no bundled libs.
- The Settings API use, the Addon Compartment wiring, and all events and the vignette payload are verified.
- Load order is right: `EventUtil.ContinueOnAddOnLoaded`/`ContinueOnPlayerLogin`, and empty saved variables are safe.
- No taint: no protected frames, and the only `hooksecurefunc` targets GatherMate2's table.
- No alerts in combat or on a taxi.
- At most 8 hit tests per frame, only while moving.
- The map maths is correct.
- `.pkgmeta` excludes the harness.

## Blockers, issues, challenges

1. GatherMate2 has no Forever build: upstream `master` is `120007,120100` and `classic` is `11509,20506,50504` (checked 2026-09-30, last push 2026-08-17). The GatherMate2 source stays dormant until it ships (TA-4).
2. The blip source depends on runtime unknowns:
   - the coordinate space of `UpdateMouseoverAtPoint`, self-calibrated from a hovered blip
   - the blip tooltip's `type` and `guid`. If every blip reports `MinimapMouseover` (21), including party members and townsfolk, then "Gathering nodes only" filters nothing and is dead weight. It only earns its place if units report `Unit` (2) or nodes report `Object` (4). `/tra types` settles this. Then keep the option, or remove it (with its key, row and README lines) if it can't tell nodes from units
   - the rotation sign with `rotateMinimap`
3. Unverified: does `PlaySound(id, "Master", true)` play with effects muted? No Blizzard file passes "Master".
4. The Settings page has only been checked against source, never seen rendered. `LIST_DELIMITER` is `","`, so a partial node-type pick may read without a space.
5. The compartment lists only addons enabled for all characters (`AddonCompartment.lua:80`).
6. Does probing change the `mouseover` unit or fire `UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT`? If so, it would disturb `@mouseover` macros. Unverified.
7. Unverified: whether `issecretvalue` raises for tainted addon code handed a secret (`FrameScriptDocumentation.lua:287-290` declares `SecretArguments = "AllowedWhenUntainted"`). The pcall makes either answer safe.
8. Unverified: when `C_Minimap.IsRotateMinimapIgnored()` returns true on Forever. The audit could not confirm that Forever uses the hybrid minimap. The call is documented and harmless when it returns false.
9. The RLE texture has not been seen in a client. Evidence that it loads: Questie 12.0.3, the Forever build installed here, ships 32-bit RLE TGAs (bottom-left origin); TradeSkillMaster ships top-left RLE TGAs on retail. Ours is top-left RLE. If the flash doesn't show, re-encode it uncompressed from `719eacf:Media/pulse_ring.tga`.

## Next steps

1. Decide TA-4: keep the GatherMate2 source, trim it to the alert only, or remove it until GatherMate2 ships for Forever.
2. Review and push `main` (2.1.0).
3. Optionally tag `v1.0.0` at `4702355` and `v2.0.0` at `719eacf`. If TA-4 removes the source, the tag preserves it.
4. Run `/console scriptErrors 1` first, with Find Herbs or Find Minerals on.
5. After the `/tra types` check, decide whether "Gathering nodes only" stays (issue 2).

Beta checks:

- [ ] Options → AddOns → Tracking Alert shows three section headers. Unticking a parent greys out its nested rows.
- [ ] The AddOns list shows Tracking Alert under the Map category.
- [ ] Picking a sound plays it, and picking the same one again stays silent. Test plays the sound and a gold flash. The flash ring shows at every thickness (TA-10).
- [ ] Hover a blip near the minimap edge: chat reports the calibration. The button then reads Recalibrate, and clicking it clears the calibration. This settles part of issue 2.
- [ ] Ride into nodes: one ping each. Leave and return within 3 minutes: silence. Reset in Remembered nodes makes them ping again.
- [ ] Run `/tra types` after a run and record the numbers: 21 = MinimapMouseover, 4 = Object, 2 = Unit. Then hover a node blip and a party member or townsfolk blip, and for each type `/dump C_TooltipInfo.GetMinimapMouseover()` without moving the cursor: record `type` and whether a `guid` shows. This settles TA-1 and issue 2.
- [ ] Rotating minimap on, turn in place: no repeat pings. Fly over nodes: silence. `/dump C_Minimap.IsRotateMinimapIgnored()` with rotation on (issue 8).
- [ ] A rare or treasure vignette that drifts off and back onto the minimap within 3 minutes pings once (TA-6).
- [ ] Mute sound effects and record whether the alert plays. This settles issue 3.
- [ ] Defaults → These Settings resets everything but keeps the calibration.
- [ ] Right-click the compartment entry with the page open: sound and flash flip live.
- [ ] Without GatherMate2: those rows are greyed out with a red tooltip notice, there's no Node types row, and nothing errors.
- [ ] In a battleground: `/dump C_Secrets.HasSecretRestrictions(), issecretvalue(GetUnitSpeed("player"))`. If the speed is secret, record that "Only while moving" then pauses the scan there. This settles TA-2.
- [ ] Watch `/eventtrace` for `UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT` while moving. This settles issue 6.
